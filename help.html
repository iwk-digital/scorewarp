  <h1>ScoreWarp Help</h1>
  <p>
    ScoreWarp is a JavaScript package that warps a score SVG produced by the [Verovio engraving
    engine](https://verovio.org/) in order to horizontally align its elements with a given physical performance
    timeline. This allows the warped score to be superimposed with any recorded time-series data, such as breathing,
    heart rate, eye gaze or an audio waveform.

  <p>
    Goebl, W., & Weigl, D. M. (2025). Letâ€™s do the ScoreWarp again! Shifting notes to performance timelines. Paper to be
    presented at the Music Encoding Conference 2025, City University London, U.K.
  </p>
  <p>
    Please refer to the [demo page](https://iwk-digital.github.io/scorewarp/) to try out its capabilities or warp your
    own files.

  <h2>How to use the ScoreWarp demo page</h2>
  <h3>Load and inspect the demo files</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Load a MEI score file and one or more MAPS files that reference the ids of the MEI file.</li>
    <li>
      Click on the "Warp" button to warp the score to the score event times (taking the first onset of a chord as
      reference)
    </li>
    <li>
      Use the "Warp notes inside chords" button to warp individual notes within chords. This visualises note-level
      asynchronies, such as arpeggios or melody lead as performed by pianists.
    </li>
    <li>Reload data if needed using the "Reload data" button.</li>
    <li>Download the warped score as an SVG file using the "Download SVG" button.</li>
    <li>Toggle (switch on and off) red vertical lines inside the score to visualize the warping effect.</li>
    <li>View the warped score and performance time in the presentation panel.</li>
  </ol>
  <h3>Upload and warp your own files</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Use the &ldquo;Warp your files&rdquo; area to upload your own MEI and MAPS files, either by drag-and-dropping the
      files onto that area, or alternatively using the button to open a file input dialog and select the list of files
      from your computer. Please provide exactly one MEI file and one or more MAPS files that reference the ids of the
      MEI file. The uploaded MEI file will be converted to a one-line score SVG and warped to each of the provided MAPS
      files. The warped scores will be compressed into a zipped file and saved to your browser's download folder. If a
      MAPS file does not reference the MEI file, it will be ignored. For more information on the MAPS file format, see
      below.
    </li>
    <li>
      As this application is run client-side on your device, all data uploaded to the browser will stay on your machine.
