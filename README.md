# ScoreWarp

ScoreWarp is a JavaScript package that warps a score SVG produced by the [Verovio engraving engine](https://verovio.org/) in order to horizontally align its elements with a given physical performance timeline. This allows the warped score to be superimposed with any recorded time-series data, such as breathing, heart rate, eye gaze or an audio waveform.
