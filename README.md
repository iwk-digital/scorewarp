# ScoreWarp

ScoreWarp is a JavaScript package that warps score SVGs in order to horizontally align with a given physical performance timeline so that the warped score can be superimposed with any recorded time-series data, such as breathing, heart rate, eye gaze or an audio recording waveform. 

It will be presented at the 2025 Music Encoding Conference in London, U.K. in June 2025 by Werner Goebl and David M. Weigl. 

Please refer to the [demo page](https://iwk-digital.github.io/scorewarp/) to try out its capabilities or warp your own files. For more information, please consult the [help page](https://iwk-digital.github.io/scorewarp/help.html).
